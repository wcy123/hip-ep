# Supported operations

This reference summarizes ONNX operations handled by the built-in ONNX-to-HIP pipeline. Support may be provided by a vendor library, a custom HIP kernel, decomposition into other operations, or standard MLIR tensor transformations.

The conversion registrations in `lib/Conversion/OnnxToHip/OnnxToHip.cpp` and the corresponding LIT/numeric tests are the source of truth. Individual operations may have data-type, rank, attribute, or dynamic-shape restrictions that are documented in their conversion and test files.

## Control flow

| Operation | Implementation |
|---|---|
| If | Outlined then/else functions with runtime branch dispatch |
| Loop | Outlined loop body with runtime loop dispatch |

## Compiler-optimized operations

These operations are handled through standard MLIR transformations and generally do not require operation-specific runtime backend support.

| Operation | Implementation | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Reshape | `tensor.expand_shape` / `tensor.collapse_shape` | Metadata-only where representable; dynamic dimensions are supported |
| Unsqueeze | `tensor.expand_shape` | Inserts size-one axes |
| Squeeze | `tensor.collapse_shape` | Removes size-one axes |
| Split | `tensor.extract_slice` | Produces tensor slices that bufferize to views |
| Slice | `tensor.extract_slice` or `hip.slice` | Constant positive-stride forms decompose to tensor slices; runtime indices or negative steps use the runtime path |
| Concat | `tensor.empty` + `tensor.insert_slice` | Bufferizes to destination subviews and copies |
| Shape | `tensor.dim` + `tensor.from_elements` | Static shapes fold to constants; dynamic dimensions remain runtime SSA |
| Constant | `arith.constant` or external constants file | Large values are externalized |
| ConstantOfShape | `arith.constant` when foldable | Produces a splat constant for constant shape inputs |
| Identity | SSA value forwarding | No runtime operation |
| Flatten | `tensor.collapse_shape` and, where needed, `tensor.expand_shape` | Metadata-only where representable |

## Fusion and preprocessing

The frontend also recognizes or simplifies selected patterns before operation conversion, including approximate/FastGelu chains, Erf-based Gelu chains, supported Pow forms, LpNormalization decompositions, CastLike simplification, and model-exporter cleanup patterns.
