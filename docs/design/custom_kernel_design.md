# Custom HIP Kernel Infrastructure

## Architecture

The existing ops (Conv, Gemm, etc.) call ROCm library APIs (MIOpen, hipBLASLt) which ship as `.lib` + `.dll`. GQA and RoPE have no such library API, so we build custom HIP kernels as a **static library** that gets linked directly into `model.dll`.

    end
```



Key insight: The `.hip` files contain `__global__` kernels compiled by hipcc into fat binaries (host + device code). When statically linked into `model.dll`, the HIP runtime extracts and launches the device code at inference time.

## File Details

### 1. `custom_kernels/cmake/hip_utils.cmake`

Adapted from onnx-hipdnn-ep. Provides `hip_add_library()` function that:

- On Windows: Uses `hipcc -c` to compile each `.hip` file to `.obj`, bundles into static lib
- On Linux: Uses CMake HIP language support
- Handles architecture flags (`--offload-arch=gfxNNNN`), MSVC ABI compatibility (`-fms-extensions`, `-fms-compatibility`), CRT flags (`/MT` static CRT), and Debug/Release configs
- Finds HIP via `HIP_PATH`, `ROCM_PATH`, or `THEROCK_DIST` environment/CMake variables

### 2. `custom_kernels/include/hip_custom_kernels.h`

Pure C header with `extern "C"` declarations -- no HIP types, only `void*`, `int64_t`, `float`, etc. This is what the runtime `.cpp` files include (compiled by Clang to bitcode). Example interface:

```c
#ifdef __cplusplus
extern "C" {
#endif

int hip_rope_forward(
    void* stream,           // hipStream_t cast to void*
    const void* input,      // GPU pointer
    const void* position_ids,
    const void* cos_cache,
    const void* sin_cache,
    void* output,
    int64_t batch_size, int64_t seq_len,
    int64_t num_heads, int64_t head_dim,
    int64_t rotary_dim,
    int64_t interleaved,
    int64_t element_size_bytes);

int hip_gqa_forward(
    void* stream,
    const void* query, const void* key, const void* value,
    const void* past_key, const void* past_value,
    const void* seqlens_k, const void* total_seq_len,
    void* output, void* present_key, void* present_value,
    int64_t batch_size, int64_t seq_len_q, int64_t seq_len_kv,
    int64_t num_heads, int64_t kv_num_heads, int64_t head_dim,
    float scale, float softcap,
    int64_t do_rotary, int64_t rotary_interleaved,
    const void* cos_cache, const void* sin_cache,
    int64_t element_size_bytes);

#ifdef __cplusplus
}
#endif
```

### 3. `custom_kernels/hip/rope_kernel.hip`

Implements the RoPE HIP kernel:

- `__global__ void rope_forward_kernel(...)` -- per-element rotary embedding: for each (batch, head, pos, dim_pair), applies cos/sin rotation
- `extern "C" int hip_rope_forward(...)` -- host launcher that calculates grid/block dims and calls `hipLaunchKernelGGL`

### 4. `custom_kernels/hip/gqa_kernel.hip`

Implements GQA as a multi-step operation:

- **KV cache update**: Concatenate current K/V with past K/V into present K/V
- **Optional RoPE**: If `do_rotary`, apply RoPE to Q and K (reuse rope logic)
- **Attention** (single-token decode): two co-resident kernel families dispatched by `lib/Runtime/real/gqa.cpp`:
  - `gqa_fused_decode` — original short-context kernel (one block per query head); preferred at small `skv` where reduction overhead would dominate.
  - `gqa_flash_decode<D, K_SPLITS>` + `gqa_flash_decode_reduce_kernel<D, K_SPLITS>` — GQA-aware split-K Flash Attention 2 for long contexts. One block per (batch, kv-head, K_SPLIT); each block stages K/V tiles into LDS once and reuses them across all HPG=4 query heads (eliminating the 4× KV bandwidth waste of per-query-head loops). Online softmax in log2e space writes `{m, l, O[D]}` partials to a workspace; the reduction kernel merges them across splits. Templated for `D ∈ {64, 128}`, `K_SPLITS=8`.
- **Prefill**: `gqa_fused_prefill` (multi-token) computes Q·K^T, softmax, and `attn·V` against the assembled KV cache.
- Can start with a straightforward implementation and optimize later (or swap in CK).

### 5. `custom_kernels/CMakeLists.txt`

Build the static library AND install both the `.lib` and `.h` to the install prefix. At model-compile time, CompilerDriver discovers the installed `.lib` from the install prefix.

```cmake
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.18)

include(${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/cmake/hip_utils.cmake)

# Default architecture if not set by parent
if(NOT HIP_ARCHITECTURES)
    set(HIP_ARCHITECTURES "gfx1103" CACHE STRING
        "Target GPU architectures for custom kernels")
endif()

# Build the static library from HIP sources
hip_add_library(hip_custom_kernels STATIC
    hip/rope_kernel.hip
    hip/gqa_kernel.hip
    INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES
        ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/include
)

# Export the library path for CompilerDriver to discover at model-compile time
set(HIP_CUSTOM_KERNELS_LIB_PATH "$<TARGET_FILE:hip_custom_kernels>" PARENT_SCOPE)

# Export include directory for Runtime bitcode compilation
set(HIP_CUSTOM_KERNELS_INCLUDE_DIR "${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/include" PARENT_SCOPE)

# Install the static library and header to the install prefix
install(TARGETS hip_custom_kernels
    ARCHIVE DESTINATION lib
    LIBRARY DESTINATION lib
)
install(FILES include/hip_custom_kernels.h DESTINATION include)
```

After `cmake --install`, the install prefix will contain:

- `<prefix>/lib/hip_custom_kernels.lib` (or `.a` on Linux)
- `<prefix>/include/hip_custom_kernels.h`

The top-level `CMakeLists.txt` gates this on real runtime builds:

```cmake
# Custom HIP kernels (GQA, RoPE) — only when building real runtime with ROCm
if(NOT BUILD_MOCK_RUNTIME)
    add_subdirectory(custom_kernels)
endif()
```

### 6. `lib/Runtime/real/rotary_embedding.cpp` and `gqa.cpp`

These are compiled to bitcode (via `clang -emit-llvm`) and merged into `runtime.bc`. They:

- Include `hip_custom_kernels.h` (pure C, Clang-compatible)
- Implement `wrap_rotary_embedding(...)` and `wrap_group_query_attention(...)` (declared in [hipdnn_ep_runtime.h](lib/Runtime/hipdnn_ep_runtime.h))
- Extract the HIP stream from `RuntimeState*` via `hipdnn_ep_state_get_stream()`
- Compute shape info from the parameters passed by the compiler lowering
- Call the `hip_rope_forward()` / `hip_gqa_forward()` C functions

### 7. `lib/Runtime/CMakeLists.txt` changes

Add the new bitcode modules to the real runtime build (around line 210):

```cmake
compile_to_bitcode(real/rotary_embedding.cpp runtime_rotary_embedding.bc)
compile_to_bitcode(real/gqa.cpp runtime_gqa.bc)
```

Add them to `RUNTIME_BC_MODULES` list. Also add `-I${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/custom_kernels/include` to the `compile_to_bitcode` macro's include flags so Clang can find `hip_custom_kernels.h`.

### 8. `lib/Compiler/CompilerDriver.cpp` changes

In `compileImpl()` (around line 180-204), add the custom kernel library to the link line. The library is discovered from the **install prefix** (same `CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH` used during build, configured via CMake at compile time):

```cpp
// Custom kernel library path - configured at CMake time from CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX
// Defined via: target_compile_definitions(... HIP_CUSTOM_KERNELS_LIB_PATH="...")
std::string custom_kernels_lib = HIP_CUSTOM_KERNELS_LIB_PATH;
if (llvm::sys::fs::exists(custom_kernels_lib)) {
    libraries.push_back(custom_kernels_lib);
    std::cout << "  Linking custom kernels: " << custom_kernels_lib << "\n";
}
```

The path is baked in at CMake configure time via a `#define`, pointing to `<install_prefix>/lib/hip_custom_kernels.lib`. This follows the same pattern as the install prefix (`../../local`) used by the project.

### 9. Install rules summary

The `custom_kernels/CMakeLists.txt` install rules ensure that after `cmake --install`:

- `<prefix>/lib/hip_custom_kernels.lib` -- static library with compiled HIP kernels (fat binaries)
- `<prefix>/include/hip_custom_kernels.h` -- pure C header for the kernel API

CompilerDriver discovers the `.lib` at model-compile time via the configured install prefix path, and passes it to DLLLinker alongside MIOpen/hipBLASLt import libs.

### 10. `custom_kernels/hip/matmul_nbits_kernel.hip`

Implements MatMulNBits — fused dequant + matmul for INT4 packed weights (FP16 activations). This is the dominant operator in INT4 LLM decode (~78% of GPU time for Llama 8B).

Four execution paths, auto-dispatched by shape:

| Path | Condition | Strategy |
|------|-----------|----------|
| WMMA | batch==1, K%32==0, M≥16 | RDNA3 wave matrix multiply with double-buffered shared memory, grid swizzling |
| GEMV col-major | batch==1, K%32==0, 1<M<16 | K-parallel GEMV with internal row→col transpose, FP16 zero points, autotuned |
| GEMV row-major | batch==1, K%32==0, M=1 | K-parallel GEMV, uint8 zero points (nibble-unpacked if packed), autotuned |
| Naive | fallback | Per-element row-major, uint8 zero points (nibble-unpacked if packed) |

**Single-token decode (M=1) uses the GEMV row-major path.** Key design choices:

- **K-parallel reduction**: Each threadblock cooperates on the K dimension for TILE_N output columns. This gives sequential per-row B access that is prefetcher-friendly on LPDDR5X (APU shared memory). An N-parallel approach (each thread reads all K/2 bytes) was tried and abandoned — scattered reads across hundreds of loads defeated the LPDDR5X prefetcher. A tiled B layout variant `[K/32, N, 16]` was also tried (28% regression).
- **Factored dequant**: Computes `(dot(A,B) - a_sum*zp) * scale`, saving ~40% FLOPs vs the naive `sum(a[k] * (b[k]-zp) * scale)`. Single multiply per group instead of per-element.
- **Vectorized B loads**: 128-bit (uint4) main loop processes 32 nibbles per transaction, with uint2 (16-nibble) and uint32 (8-nibble) remainder phases. Load-compute separation issues all B loads before FMA compute. Explicit `__fmaf_rn` intrinsics for dot product accumulation.
- **Runtime autotune**: First call for each (M,N,K,block_size) benchmarks all 35 (BLOCK_SIZE, TILE_N) configurations and caches the fastest. BLOCK_SIZE ∈ {32,64,128,256,512,1024}, TILE_N ∈ {1,2,4,8,16,32,64}. BS=32 configs use single-warp shuffle-only reduction (no LDS). TILE_N=32 tested only when N≥1024; TILE_N=64 only when N≥2048.
- **Compile-time warp size**: RDNA 3 (gfx11xx) runs wave32 by default. The reduction uses `constexpr int WARP_SIZE = 32` for dead-code elimination — a runtime `__builtin_amdgcn_wavefrontsize()` check caused 13% regression due to both branches being compiled for every template instantiation.
- **Single-warp fast path**: For BLOCK_SIZE=32 (one wave on RDNA 3), `if constexpr (BLOCK_SIZE <= WARP_SIZE)` eliminates the shared memory reduction entirely — warp shuffle result is final, no `__syncthreads` or LDS write/read needed.
- **M=1 col-major bypass**: For M=1 decode, the GEMV path skips the col-major GEMV route (which requires FP16 zero-point conversion via `convertZpToFp16`) and falls through to the row-major GEMV path which reads uint8 zero_points natively. Saves 225 kernel launches per Llama 8B inference. The M=1 autotune cache key also deduplicates row/col entries since the layouts are identical for a single row.
- **Packed nibble ZP unpacking**: ONNX MatMulNBits stores zero_points as packed nibbles when `zp_elem_size==1`: shape `[N, ceil(k_blocks/2)]` with two 4-bit ZPs per byte (low nibble = even group, high nibble = odd group). The GEMV row-major and naive paths index ZPs as `zp[n * k_blocks + grp]` expecting one byte per group. A `unpack_zp_nibbles_to_u8_kernel` unpacks to `[N, k_blocks]` uint8 (one ZP per byte) into a persistent grow-on-demand GPU buffer before dispatch. Without this, block_size=128 models (e.g. Qwen2.5-14B) cause 2x out-of-bounds GPU memory reads and crash. The WMMA/col-major paths use `convertZpToFp16` which already handles packed nibbles correctly.
- **Optimization attempts that regressed**: K-loop unroll x2 (+5% register spilling), nontemporal stores (+3%, output too small to pollute cache), N-parallel tiled GEMV (+28%, prefetcher defeated). All reverted with comments documenting the regression.

**Weight layout**: B is stored as `[N, K/2]` with pairs of 4-bit values packed into bytes (low nibble first). Scales are per quantization group: `[N, ceil(K/block_size)]`. Zero-points may be individual uint8 `[N, k_blocks]` or packed nibbles `[N, ceil(k_blocks/2)]` — determined by `zp_elem_size` (1 = packed nibbles, 2 = individual uint8/uint16). block_size is always power-of-2 (typically 32 or 128), enabling bit-shift group index calculation.

**WMMA path** (prefill, M≥16): Transposes A/C to column-major internally, converts uint8 zero-points to FP16, then uses `__builtin_amdgcn_wmma_f16_16x16x16_f16` intrinsics with double-buffered shared memory for A tiles and grid swizzling (Morton-order blocks) for L2 cache locality.

## Key Design Decisions

- **Static lib, not DLL**: The kernel code is embedded in `model.dll` via static linking. No extra DLL dependency beyond amdhip64.dll.
- **Pure C header interface**: The header uses only C types (`void`*, `int64_t`, `float`) so it can be included by Clang during bitcode compilation AND by MSVC if needed.
- **Separation of concerns**: `.hip` files contain device code (compiled by hipcc); `.cpp` runtime wrappers contain host logic (compiled by Clang to bitcode). They communicate through the C header.
- `**hip_utils.cmake` reuse**: Proven approach from onnx-hipdnn-ep, handles Windows hipcc compilation, multi-config generators, architecture flags.
