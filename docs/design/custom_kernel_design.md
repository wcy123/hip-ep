# Custom HIP Kernel Infrastructure

## Architecture

The existing ops (Conv, Gemm, etc.) call ROCm library APIs (hipBLASLt) which ship as `.lib` + `.dll`. GQA, RoPE, and the other ops without ROCm-library coverage are built as **per-arch shared libraries** (`custom_kernels_<arch>.{dll,so}`) that ship next to the EP binary. `LlvmIrJit` `dlopen`s the matching variant at JIT init based on the device's `gcnArchName`, so the per-model bitcode never carries kernel code.

Key insight: The `.hip` files contain `__global__` kernels compiled by hipcc into fat binaries (host + device code). They live in `custom_kernels_<arch>.{dll,so}` co-located with the EP binary, NOT inside the per-model artifact. `LlvmIrJit` resolves `hip_*` launcher symbols against this shared library at JIT init via `DynamicLibrarySearchGenerator::Load`, anchored on `GetModuleFileName` / `dladdr` of the EP DLL.

## File Details

### 1. `lib/Runtime/Kernels/cmake/hip_utils.cmake`

Adapted from hip-ep. Provides `hip_add_library()` function that:

- On Windows: Uses `hipcc -c` to compile each `.hip` file to `.obj`, bundles into static lib
- On Linux: Uses CMake HIP language support
- Handles architecture flags (`--offload-arch=gfxNNNN`), MSVC ABI compatibility (`-fms-extensions`, `-fms-compatibility`), CRT flags (`/MT` static CRT), and Debug/Release configs
- Finds HIP via `HIP_PATH`, `ROCM_PATH`, or `THEROCK_DIST` environment/CMake variables

### 2. `lib/Runtime/Kernels/include/hip_custom_kernels.h`

Pure C header with `extern "C"` declarations -- no HIP types, only `void*`, `int64_t`, `float`, etc. This is what the runtime `.cpp` files include (compiled by Clang to bitcode). Example interface:

```c
#ifdef __cplusplus
extern "C" {
#endif

int hip_rope_forward(
    void* stream,           // hipStream_t cast to void*
    const void* input,      // GPU pointer
    const void* position_ids,
    const void* cos_cache,
    const void* sin_cache,
    void* output,
    int64_t batch_size, int64_t seq_len,
    int64_t num_heads, int64_t head_dim,
    int64_t rotary_dim,
    int64_t interleaved,
    int64_t element_size_bytes);

int hip_gqa_forward(
    void* stream,
    const void* query, const void* key, const void* value,
    const void* past_key, const void* past_value,
    const void* seqlens_k, const void* total_seq_len,
    void* output, void* present_key, void* present_value,
    int64_t batch_size, int64_t seq_len_q, int64_t seq_len_kv,
    int64_t num_heads, int64_t kv_num_heads, int64_t head_dim,
    float scale, float softcap,
    int64_t do_rotary, int64_t rotary_interleaved,
    const void* cos_cache, const void* sin_cache,
    int64_t element_size_bytes);

#ifdef __cplusplus
}
#endif
```

### 3. `lib/Runtime/Kernels/hip/rope_kernel.hip`

Implements the RoPE HIP kernel:

- `__global__ void rope_forward_kernel(...)` -- per-element rotary embedding: for each (batch, head, pos, dim_pair), applies cos/sin rotation
- `extern "C" int hip_rope_forward(...)` -- host launcher that calculates grid/block dims and calls `hipLaunchKernelGGL`

### 4. `lib/Runtime/Kernels/hip/gqa_kernel.hip`

Implements GQA as a multi-step operation:

- **KV cache update**: Concatenate current K/V with past K/V into present K/V
- **Optional RoPE**: If `do_rotary`, apply RoPE to Q and K (reuse rope logic)
- **Attention** (single-token decode): two co-resident kernel families dispatched by `lib/Runtime/real/gqa.cpp`:
  - `gqa_fused_decode` — short-context kernel (one block per query head); preferred at small `skv` where the split-K reduction overhead would dominate. Uses LDS-tiled K/V prefetch: each outer iteration cooperatively stages `TILE=8` rows of K and V into shared memory, then the inner loop crunches 8 softmax steps from LDS. This drives memory-level parallelism via TILE (16 outstanding loads per thread per tile) rather than wave count, since the decode grid (B=1, H=32 → ~32 blocks / ~128 waves on RDNA3 wave32) is too small to hide ~400-cycle global-load latency by wave switching. LDS use per block: `2 * TILE * D * sizeof(_Float16)` = 8 KB at D=128. No `__syncthreads` is needed between prefetch and inner loop because each thread writes only its own column (`K_tile[i*D + tid]`) and reads only its own column. TILE=8 chosen by sweep: TILE=4 loses to outer-loop overhead at small skv; TILE=16 saturates the per-thread outstanding-load budget.
  - `gqa_flash_decode<D, K_SPLITS>` + `gqa_flash_decode_reduce_kernel<D, K_SPLITS>` — GQA-aware split-K Flash Attention 2 for long contexts. One block per (batch, kv-head, K_SPLIT); each block stages K/V tiles into LDS once and reuses them across all HPG=4 query heads (eliminating the 4× KV bandwidth waste of per-query-head loops). Online softmax in log2e space writes `{m, l, O[D]}` partials to a workspace; the reduction kernel merges them across splits. Templated for `D ∈ {64, 128}`, `K_SPLITS=8`.
- **Prefill**: `gqa_fused_prefill` (multi-token) computes Q·K^T, softmax, and `attn·V` against the assembled KV cache.
- Can start with a straightforward implementation and optimize later (or swap in CK).

### 5. `lib/Runtime/Kernels/CMakeLists.txt`

Build one SHARED library per arch in `HIP_ARCHITECTURES`, each carrying a single fatbin slice for that arch. Install side-by-side with the EP binary so `LlvmIrJit` finds it via `GetModuleFileName` / `dladdr` anchoring. No static archive is produced.

```cmake
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.18)

include(${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/cmake/hip_utils.cmake)

# Require HIP_ARCHITECTURES (no silent default that may not match hardware)
if(NOT HIP_ARCHITECTURES)
    message(FATAL_ERROR "HIP_ARCHITECTURES is not set.")
endif()

set(_kernel_sources
    hip/rope_kernel.hip
    hip/gqa_kernel.hip
    # ... ~30 more .hip TUs
)

# One SHARED target per arch; OFFLOAD_ARCHS narrows the global list to a
# single element so each DLL/SO carries one fatbin slice instead of N.
foreach(_arch IN LISTS HIP_ARCHITECTURES)
    set(_target custom_kernels_${_arch})
    hip_add_library(${_target} SHARED ${_kernel_sources}
        INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/include
        OFFLOAD_ARCHS       ${_arch}
    )
    install(TARGETS ${_target}
        RUNTIME DESTINATION bin   # Windows .dll co-located with EP .dll
        LIBRARY DESTINATION lib   # Linux .so co-located with EP .so
        ARCHIVE DESTINATION lib   # Windows import lib (unused by EP, harmless)
    )
endforeach()

set(HIP_CUSTOM_KERNELS_INCLUDE_DIR "${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/include" PARENT_SCOPE)
```

After `cmake --install`, the install prefix contains one DLL/SO per requested arch:

- Windows: `<prefix>/bin/custom_kernels_gfx1100.dll`, `<prefix>/bin/custom_kernels_gfx1151.dll`, ...
- Linux:   `<prefix>/lib/libcustom_kernels_gfx1100.so`, `<prefix>/lib/libcustom_kernels_gfx1151.so`, ...

The header is intentionally NOT installed: the EP-side build always uses the in-tree header at `lib/Runtime/Kernels/include/hip_custom_kernels.h` so the host-side declarations stay in lockstep with the kernel TUs.

The top-level `CMakeLists.txt` adds the subdir on real-runtime EP builds (the per-arch SHARED targets are needed by `backend-mlir-compiler/custom-op-mlir/CMakeLists.txt` to register `add_dependencies`):

```cmake
if(NOT BUILD_MOCK_RUNTIME AND NOT _CUSTOM_KERNELS_SUBDIR_ADDED)
    add_subdirectory(lib/Runtime/Kernels)
    set(_CUSTOM_KERNELS_SUBDIR_ADDED TRUE)
endif()
```

### 6. `lib/Runtime/real/rotary_embedding.cpp` and `gqa.cpp`

These are compiled to bitcode (via `clang -emit-llvm`) and merged into `runtime.bc`. They:

- Include `hip_custom_kernels.h` (pure C, Clang-compatible)
- Implement `wrap_rotary_embedding(...)` and `wrap_group_query_attention(...)` (declared in [hipdnn_ep_runtime.h](lib/Runtime/hipdnn_ep_runtime.h))
- Extract the HIP stream from `RuntimeState*` via `hipdnn_ep_state_get_stream()`
- Compute shape info from the parameters passed by the compiler lowering
- Call the `hip_rope_forward()` / `hip_gqa_forward()` C functions

### 7. `lib/Runtime/CMakeLists.txt` changes

Add the new bitcode modules to the real runtime build (around line 210):

```cmake
compile_to_bitcode(real/rotary_embedding.cpp runtime_rotary_embedding.bc)
compile_to_bitcode(real/gqa.cpp runtime_gqa.bc)
```

Add them to `RUNTIME_BC_MODULES` list. Also add `-I${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/lib/Runtime/Kernels/include` to the `compile_to_bitcode` macro's include flags so Clang can find `hip_custom_kernels.h`.

### 8. Consumer-side resolution in `LlvmIrJit::create`

The compiler is no longer involved in linking against the kernel library — the per-model bitcode keeps external `hip_*` declarations and resolution happens at JIT init inside the EP DLL:

```cpp
// lib/Runtime/Kernels installs custom_kernels_<arch>.{dll,so} next
// to the EP binary. LlvmIrJit picks the matching variant via gcnArchName.
const std::string kernel_arch = detectCustomKernelArch();   // hipGetDeviceProperties
const std::string basename =
#ifdef _WIN32
    "custom_kernels_" + kernel_arch + ".dll";
#else
    "libcustom_kernels_" + kernel_arch + ".so";
#endif
std::string kernel_lib = thisModuleDirectory();             // GetModuleFileName / dladdr
kernel_lib += path_sep;
kernel_lib += basename;

auto gen = llvm::orc::DynamicLibrarySearchGenerator::Load(
    kernel_lib.c_str(), global_prefix);
jit->getMainJITDylib().addGenerator(std::move(*gen));
```

`thisModuleDirectory()` anchors the lookup to the EP DLL's own directory, so the kernel SO/DLL resolves through the loader without any `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` / `PATH` dependency. The generator is added BEFORE `GetForCurrentProcess` so the per-arch DLL takes priority over any look-alike symbol that may live in another already-loaded module.

### 9. Install layout

After `cmake --install`, the install prefix contains:

- Windows: `<prefix>/bin/onnxruntime_morphizen_ep.dll` (the EP) and `<prefix>/bin/custom_kernels_<arch>.dll` (one per requested arch) co-located.
- Linux:   `<prefix>/lib/libonnxruntime_morphizen_ep.so` (the EP) and `<prefix>/lib/libcustom_kernels_<arch>.so` (one per requested arch) co-located. The EP `.so` is built with `RPATH=$ORIGIN`.

CI workflows assert co-location by checking for `custom_kernels_gfx1151.dll` / `libcustom_kernels_gfx1151.so` in the staging step — failure here means the install rule in `lib/Runtime/Kernels/CMakeLists.txt` regressed.

### 10. `lib/Runtime/Kernels/hip/matmul_nbits_kernel.hip`

Implements MatMulNBits — fused dequant + matmul for INT4 packed weights (FP16 activations). This is the dominant operator in INT4 LLM decode (~78% of GPU time for Llama 8B).

Four execution paths, auto-dispatched by shape:

| Path | Condition | Strategy |
|------|-----------|----------|
| WMMA | batch==1, K%32==0, M≥16 | RDNA3 wave matrix multiply with double-buffered shared memory, grid swizzling |
| GEMV col-major | batch==1, K%32==0, 1<M<16 | K-parallel GEMV with internal row→col transpose, FP16 zero points, autotuned |
| GEMV row-major | batch==1, K%32==0, M=1 | K-parallel GEMV, uint8 zero points (nibble-unpacked if packed), autotuned |
| Naive | fallback | Per-element row-major, uint8 zero points (nibble-unpacked if packed) |

**Single-token decode (M=1) uses the GEMV row-major path.** Key design choices:

- **K-parallel reduction**: Each threadblock cooperates on the K dimension for TILE_N output columns. This gives sequential per-row B access that is prefetcher-friendly on LPDDR5X (APU shared memory). An N-parallel approach (each thread reads all K/2 bytes) was tried and abandoned — scattered reads across hundreds of loads defeated the LPDDR5X prefetcher. A tiled B layout variant `[K/32, N, 16]` was also tried (28% regression).
- **Factored dequant**: Computes `(dot(A,B) - a_sum*zp) * scale`, saving ~40% FLOPs vs the naive `sum(a[k] * (b[k]-zp) * scale)`. Single multiply per group instead of per-element.
- **Vectorized B loads**: 128-bit (uint4) main loop processes 32 nibbles per transaction, with uint2 (16-nibble) and uint32 (8-nibble) remainder phases. Load-compute separation issues all B loads before FMA compute. Explicit `__fmaf_rn` intrinsics for dot product accumulation.
- **Runtime autotune**: First call for each (M,N,K,block_size) benchmarks all 35 (BLOCK_SIZE, TILE_N) configurations and caches the fastest. BLOCK_SIZE ∈ {32,64,128,256,512,1024}, TILE_N ∈ {1,2,4,8,16,32,64}. BS=32 configs use single-warp shuffle-only reduction (no LDS). TILE_N=32 tested only when N≥1024; TILE_N=64 only when N≥2048.
- **Compile-time warp size**: RDNA 3 (gfx11xx) runs wave32 by default. The reduction uses `constexpr int WARP_SIZE = 32` for dead-code elimination — a runtime `__builtin_amdgcn_wavefrontsize()` check caused 13% regression due to both branches being compiled for every template instantiation.
- **Single-warp fast path**: For BLOCK_SIZE=32 (one wave on RDNA 3), `if constexpr (BLOCK_SIZE <= WARP_SIZE)` eliminates the shared memory reduction entirely — warp shuffle result is final, no `__syncthreads` or LDS write/read needed.
- **M=1 col-major bypass**: For M=1 decode, the GEMV path skips the col-major GEMV route (which requires FP16 zero-point conversion via `convertZpToFp16`) and falls through to the row-major GEMV path which reads uint8 zero_points natively. Saves 225 kernel launches per Llama 8B inference. The M=1 autotune cache key also deduplicates row/col entries since the layouts are identical for a single row.
- **Packed nibble ZP unpacking**: ONNX MatMulNBits stores zero_points as packed nibbles when `zp_elem_size==1`: shape `[N, ceil(k_blocks/2)]` with two 4-bit ZPs per byte (low nibble = even group, high nibble = odd group). The GEMV row-major and naive paths index ZPs as `zp[n * k_blocks + grp]` expecting one byte per group. A `unpack_zp_nibbles_to_u8_kernel` unpacks to `[N, k_blocks]` uint8 (one ZP per byte) into a persistent grow-on-demand GPU buffer before dispatch. Without this, block_size=128 models (e.g. Qwen2.5-14B) cause 2x out-of-bounds GPU memory reads and crash. The WMMA/col-major paths use `convertZpToFp16` which already handles packed nibbles correctly.
- **Optimization attempts that regressed**: K-loop unroll x2 (+5% register spilling), nontemporal stores (+3%, output too small to pollute cache), N-parallel tiled GEMV (+28%, prefetcher defeated). All reverted with comments documenting the regression.

**Weight layout**: B is stored as `[N, K/2]` with pairs of 4-bit values packed into bytes (low nibble first). Scales are per quantization group: `[N, ceil(K/block_size)]`. Zero-points may be the packed integer stream (`zp_elem_size==1`: packed nibbles for bits=4, 4-per-byte for bits=2, a continuous 3-bit stream for bits=3) or per-group FP16 `[N, k_blocks]` (`zp_elem_size==2`). block_size is always power-of-2 (typically 32 or 128), enabling bit-shift group index calculation.

**bits=2 fractional FP16 zero-points**: AMD Quark 2-bit models encode the non-uniform levels `[-1, -1/3, 1/3, 1]` in the `(index - zero_point) * scale` form by using a *fractional* zero-point of `1.5` (the `2/3` factor is folded into the per-group scale). These arrive as an FP16 zero-point tensor (`zp_elem_size==2`, one value per group), which must be read as FP16 — rounding to an integer would corrupt the `1.5`. The u2 GEMV, WMMA (fused inline-decode and dequant+GEMM), and naive kernels are templated on the zero-point element type (`uint8_t` for the packed-integer path, `_Float16`/`__half` for this path); the dequant math is already float, so the FP16 path matches the uint8 path's performance and the integer path is unchanged. The FP16 buffer is one value per group already, so it is passed straight through with no unpack/convert step.

**WMMA path** (prefill, M≥16): Transposes A/C to column-major internally, converts uint8 zero-points to FP16, then uses `__builtin_amdgcn_wmma_f16_16x16x16_f16` intrinsics with double-buffered shared memory for A tiles and grid swizzling (Morton-order blocks) for L2 cache locality.

## Key Design Decisions

- **Per-arch SHARED library, not static lib**: One `custom_kernels_<arch>.{dll,so}` per arch in `HIP_ARCHITECTURES`, each with a single fatbin slice. Co-located with the EP binary; `LlvmIrJit::create` `dlopen`s the matching variant at JIT init based on `gcnArchName`. Per-model bitcode stays free of GPU code, which is what keeps it OS-portable and bytewise-stable across model recompiles when only the host CRT changes.
- **Pure C header interface**: The header uses only C types (`void`*, `int64_t`, `float`) so it can be included by Clang during bitcode compilation AND by MSVC if needed.
- **Separation of concerns**: `.hip` files contain device code (compiled by hipcc); `.cpp` runtime wrappers contain host logic (compiled by Clang to bitcode and embedded as `runtime.bc` inside the EP DLL). They communicate through the C header.
- **`hip_utils.cmake` reuse**: Proven approach for Windows hipcc compilation, multi-config generators, architecture flags. The `OFFLOAD_ARCHS` arg overrides the global `HIP_ARCHITECTURES` so each per-arch target builds a single-slice fatbin instead of a multi-slice bloated one.
