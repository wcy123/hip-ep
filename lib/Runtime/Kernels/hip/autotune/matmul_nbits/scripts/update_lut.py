"""MatMulNBits autotune LUT pipeline: measure -> fit -> build -> compile.

The winners come from the in-kernel autotuner, read off its debug log. Nothing
here re-implements "which config is fastest": there is one implementation of
that and it is the one that ships, so the table cannot drift from the runtime's
own judgement.

The table is a set of measured points plus a per-phase fallback; a lookup takes
the nearest point in log space over (M, N, K) within an exactly-matched
categorical group. See matmul_nbits_autotune.fbs for why.

The sweep log carries the full per-config timing table at every measured point,
not just the winner, and that is what makes `fit` possible: the cost of handing
a shape its neighbour's config can be read off the shape's own timings rather
than guessed at.
