# MatMulNBits offline autotune LUT

Ships the winning kernel config for shapes we have measured, so the first call
on a new shape does not have to pay for a runtime sweep. Modelled on the GQA
LUT next door (`../gqa/`), with three match tiers instead of five — the
MatMulNBits key space is much smaller, because `N` and `K` are model constants
rather than runtime geometry.

Currently populated for **bits=4 on gfx1151**. The schema reserves the other
bit widths; adding them is a table regeneration, not a schema change.

## Where it sits

```
map cache hit           -> use it
map miss, LUT hit       -> use it, and write it into the map
both miss               -> runtime sweep, as before
```

The map stays in front of the LUT deliberately. It holds measurements from this
exact machine and build, which beat a table tuned on a reference part. The LUT's
job is to make the *first* encounter with a shape free, not to override
something already measured locally. Writing LUT hits into the map means the
lookup runs once per shape per process rather than once per call.

A miss at every tier is not an error — the caller sweeps and everything behaves
as it did before the LUT existed. That is also what happens on an arch with no
table, or when the table is rejected as incompatible.

## The three tiers

Probed finest first; the first row that exists **and** whose geometry the live
config table still accepts wins.

| Tier | Key | Answers |
|---|---|---|
| **Exact** | phase, bits, `N`, `K`, group_size, zero-point, row-stride, M-bucket | the shapes in `shapes/` — every MatMulNBits node in 20 shipped models |
| **Fuzzy** | same, but `N` and `K` collapsed to octave buckets | a model nobody measured whose layer dims land near a measured one |
| **Fallback** | phase + bits only | guarantees a hit; the config that won most often for that phase |

`phase` is not just prefill/decode. It is one of `Prefill` (WMMA tiles),
`Decode` (fp16 GEMV) and `DecodeDp4a` (W4A8 integer-dot GEMV). The two decode
kernels read the same `kGemvConfigs` table but rank it differently, which is why
they already keep separate tune caches at runtime — they need separate rows for
the same reason.

Row stride is part of the prefill key because a padded buffer has a different
winner (measured: cfg11 -> cfg3 at N=5120 K=4096), so the two layouts must not
share a row.

## Why the row stores geometry, not a config index

`kWmmaConfigs` and `kGemvConfigs` are edited from time to time — the
`TILE_N=32/64` removal is a recent example — and an index into them is only
meaningful for the exact table it was measured against. A stale index silently
launches the wrong kernel.

So a row stores the tile geometry (`bm, bn, swizzle, wt_m, wt_n, bk, fused`, or
`threads, tile_n`), and the runtime looks that geometry up in the live table
while probing. A geometry the table no longer contains, or that is illegal for
this shape, makes the probe **fall through to the next tier** instead of
returning something unlaunchable. Stale table, degraded answer, never a wrong
one.

`kernel_abi` (`"matmul_nbits-v1"`) is the coarser guard: bump it when a config's *meaning*
changes rather than its existence, and the whole table is rejected.

## Regenerating

```powershell
# 1. shape inventory (only when the model set changes)
python scripts/extract_shapes.py `
    --models ../../../../../../ModelFiles/oga_models `
    --out shapes/oga_models_bits4.csv --bits 4

# 2. build the sweep driver. It links tools/empty_lut_data.cpp on purpose:
#    with the real table linked it would get LUT hits for the very shapes it is
#    supposed to be measuring.
clang++ -x hip --offload-arch=gfx1151 -O3 -std=c++17 -w `
    -I lib/Runtime/Kernels/include -I <flatbuffers include> -I <generated header dir> `
    tools/matmul_nbits_autotune_sweep.cpp tools/empty_lut_data.cpp matmul_nbits_autotune.cpp `
    ../../matmul_nbits_kernel.hip -o mn_sweep.exe

# 3. measure -> build -> compile
python scripts/update_lut.py all --sweep mn_sweep.exe --flatc <flatc>
```

Each sweep process starts with an empty in-process tune map (the tuners no
longer persist to an on-disk cache), so every shape is measured fresh and none
is silently skipped.

The winners come from the in-kernel autotuner, read off its debug log. Nothing
in the pipeline re-implements "which config is fastest" — there is one
implementation of that and it is the one that ships, so the table cannot drift
from the runtime's own judgement.

### Sweep scope

`N >= 65536` (the vocab projection) is swept at `M=1` only. Its B runs to
600 MB and a WMMA sweep is ~680 dispatches over it — tens of minutes per point —
for an M that inference never issues, since logits are computed for the last
token. Fuzzy and Fallback still answer if some caller does hand one a wide M.

## Embedding

Only `lut/<arch>.fb` ships. `lib/Runtime/Kernels/CMakeLists.txt` turns it into
the `kMatmulNbitsLutBlobs[]` symbol linked into `custom_kernels_<arch>` using
pure CMake (`file(READ ... HEX)`) — no Python, and no generated `.cpp` is
committed (the compiled array is exactly the `.fb`'s bytes, ~40 KB; the source
text is not). This is per-arch, not in `runtime.bc` the way the GQA table is, so
each DLL carries exactly the table it can use. flatbuffers is header-only for
reading, so this adds an include path and no link dependency.

An arch with no measured `.fb` still builds — `_emit_lut_registry` emits an
empty registry (`kMatmulNbitsLutBlobs` with count 0), the loader finds no table,
and every shape falls through to the sweep. Adding an arch is a table addition (a
`.fb`), never a build break.

`HIPDNN_MATMUL_LUT_LOG=1` logs load status, per-lookup tier hits, and misses.
`HIPDNN_MATMUL_AUTOTUNE_MODE=online` bypasses the table and runs the in-kernel
autotune sweep instead (default `lookup` uses the table); the
`matmul_autotune_mode` provider option selects the same thing at lower
precedence, and the mode is latched process-wide by whichever session resolves
it first.
`HIPDNN_MATMUL_AUTOTUNE_LOG=1` logs the in-kernel tuner's decisions — every
candidate's timing, the winning config's full geometry, LUT hits, and the
cached selection — to stderr. Unlike `HIPDNN_MATMUL_LUT_LOG` (which only covers
the offline-table lookup that `online` mode skips), this shows what the sweep
actually picked, so an `online` run can be diffed against the shipped table.
`HIPDNN_EP_DEBUG=1` still enables these lines too (plus everything else).
