 * Wavefront-size / matrix-intrinsic portability shim.
 *
 * The custom kernels were originally written for RDNA3/RDNA4 (gfx11xx/gfx12xx),
 * which run wave32 and expose the WMMA matrix intrinsics
 * (__builtin_amdgcn_wmma_*). CDNA (gfx9xx, e.g. MI300/MI350) runs wave64 and has
 * no WMMA -- it uses MFMA instead. This header lets the shared kernel sources
 * compile for both families:
 *
 *   HIPDNN_WAVE_SIZE  compile-time wavefront size in the *device* pass
 *                     (64 on CDNA/gfx9xx, 32 on RDNA/gfx10xx+). Used to make
 *                     warp-shuffle reductions span the whole wave correctly.
 *   HIPDNN_HAS_WMMA   1 only in a device pass for an arch that has one of the
 *                     WMMA f16 16x16x16 builtins below (RDNA3/RDNA3.5/RDNA4).
 *                     0 on CDNA and in the host pass, so WMMA code paths
 *                     compile away (and are never launched -- the host
 *                     dispatch checks the device warpSize at runtime).
 *   HIPDNN_WMMA_GFX12 1 when only the newer, gfx12-style WMMA encoding is
 *                     available (see below). Selects the fragment layout the
 *                     kernels must use.
 *
 * ROCm 7.x no longer defines __AMDGCN_WAVEFRONT_SIZE[_], so we key off the
 * clang-provided GPU-family macros (__GFX8__, __GFX9__, __GFX11__, __GFX12__)
 * for the wave size. WMMA support/layout, however, is NOT reliably keyed off
 * those family macros: gfx1170 ("RDNA 4m") is numbered under the gfx11 family
 * (__GFX11__ is defined, __GFX12__ is not) but its hardware does not implement
 * the original gfx11 WMMA encoding (WMMA256bInsts) at all -- only the newer,
 * unified encoding introduced for gfx12 (WMMA128bInsts). Concretely, on this
 * target __has_builtin(__builtin_amdgcn_wmma_f32_16x16x16_f16_w32) is false
 * and __has_builtin(..._w32_gfx12) is true, even though __GFX11__ is set.
 * Verified by compiling a probe for each target with AMD clang 23.0.0git:
 *   gfx1100/1102/1150/1151/gfx11-generic -> old builtin only, __GFX11__
 *   gfx1170                              -> new (_gfx12) builtin only, __GFX11__
 *   gfx1200/1201/gfx12-generic           -> new (_gfx12) builtin only, __GFX12__
 * So WMMA capability/layout must be probed via __has_builtin against the
 * *builtin names*, not the family macros -- that automatically resolves per
 * the actual -offload-arch of each object in a multi-arch build, which is
 * exactly the "pick the right code per machine" behavior HIP's fat-binary
 * loader then dispatches at load time.
 *
 * The two encodings differ in exactly three ways (see gemm_wmma_kernel.hip /
 * gqa_kernel.hip for the empirically-verified per-lane formulas):
 *   - fragment width: 16 elements/lane (gfx11, K replicated across lane/16)
 *     vs 8 elements/lane (gfx12-style, K split by lane/16, no replication)
 *   - the builtin itself (plain vs "_gfx12" suffix)
 *   - accumulator row mapping: e*2+pair (gfx11, interleaved) vs pair*8+e
 *     (gfx12-style, blocked). The M/N<->lane mapping (row=lane%16 for A,
 *     col=lane%16 for B/output) is identical between the two encodings.
