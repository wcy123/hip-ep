## Contributing

Before contributing, please review:
1. [Git Workflow](workflows/git-workflow.md) - Required branch and commit workflow
2. [Developer Guide](developer-guide.md) - Development environment setup
3. [PR Workflow](workflows/pr-workflow.md) - Pull request process

## Documentation Organization

This documentation follows a clear structure:

- **`/docs/`** - All project documentation (this directory)
  - **Core guides** at the top level (architecture, developer guide)
  - **`/technical/`** - Deep-dive technical documentation
  - **`/workflows/`** - Development workflows and processes
- **Component docs** - In each component's directory (morphizen-graph/README.md, etc.)
- **Root README** - Project overview and quick start

## Need Help?

- Check the [Developer Guide troubleshooting section](developer-guide.md#troubleshooting)
- Review [Technical Deep-Dives](#technical-deep-dives) for specific topics
- Look at component-specific READMEs for detailed API information
- See [PR Workflow](workflows/pr-workflow.md) for collaboration processes
